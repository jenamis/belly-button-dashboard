# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to create a dashboard webpage that displays data for volunteers who participated in a study of belly button biodiversity. The dashboard allows users to select a volunteer ID # and then populates demographic information and three charts with data related to bacteria found in their belly button.  

The files used to build the dashboard webpage can be found here:
-    [JSON file](samples.json) of data for study volunteers and their belly button bacteria
-    [JavaScript file](static/js/charts.js) using D3.js to retrieve and interact with the data and Plotly to create the charts
-    [HTML template file](index.html) using Bootstrap components and CSS for the dashboard layout and appearance
